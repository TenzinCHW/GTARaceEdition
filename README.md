# GTA: Race Edition

This is a small project I am doing as the Graduate Teaching Assistant of 50.002 Computation Structures, Fall 2019 at SUTD.
The goal is to build a game on the Mojo V3 FPGA with physical game interfaces. This project will be recreating an arcade racing game.
There are a few directories that can be built as standalone Mojo projects, but they contain modules that I hope to integrate into the actual game.
